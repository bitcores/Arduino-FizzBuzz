# Arduino-FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz implemented on Arduino

I am purposefully not using the modulus operator in this one, instead I am making use of the difference between integer and floating point division to determine the multiples

This is also making use of two 4x2 LED matrix arrays, if you Google ht1632 you will find these displays. I don't know if the code I am using for them is the best or better than any others you will find out there but it is working for Arduino 1.6, and some versions you may find are not compatible with newer versions of the Arduino IDE.
